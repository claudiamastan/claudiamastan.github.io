Recent graduate with Bachelor in Computer Science, specializing in Information, from University of California, Irvine.
<br><br>My interest includes full stack web development and UI/UX Design. 
My technical skills include HTML, CSS, JS, Python, Java, SQL, C++, C, as well as using CLI in Linux environment. 
Throughout my programming journey, I have developed a strong object-oriented background, learned to implement data structures, and applied good coding practices (clean code, TDD, debugging).
