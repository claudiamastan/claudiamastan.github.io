I'm a fourth-year Computer Science undergraduate with specialization in Information at University of California, Irvine.
<br><br>My interest includes full stack development and UI/UX Design. 
Currently, I have working knowledge of C++, C, Java, Python, SQL, as well as using VIM in Linux environment. 
Along the way, I have developed a strong object-oriented background, learned to implement data structures, and applied good coding practices. 
Aside from programming, I have years of experience in Graphic Design/Marketing.
<br>When I'm not tinkering with code, I like to doodle, cook, or watch movies.
