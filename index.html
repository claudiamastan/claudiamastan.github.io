                I graduated with Bachelor in Computer Science, specializing in Information, from University of California, Irvine.<br>
                I developed a strong object-oriented background, learned to implement data structures, and applied good coding practices (clean code, TDD, debugging). 
                It prepared me to work in data-driven systems. Some of the topics that I learned include database management, information retrieval, and data-mining.
                <br><br>
                During my last year at UCI, I was involved in two project-based classes on building a web application. 
                From these classes I had the chance to work using different technologies (such as Node, MongoDB, Apache, Java, and MySQL) that are used to build the web. 
                One of the project classes was extended into a research opportunity, where I had the chance to explore more on front-end development.
                <br><br>
                While I was still attending school, I worked at <a href="http://www.axxera.com">Axxera, Inc</a> as a UI/Graphic Designer, 
                where I learned to build UI prototypes for web applications with Figma.

                Built a prototype of one-handed video game controller designed for people with limited mobility on one hand. 
                The prototype was intended to be used for PC games. Built on Arduino and used joystick, gyroscope, and buttons as its components to replicate function of a mouse.
                Worked on functional testing for each component.
